It was granted numerous awards for its efficient design and was one of the company’s best-selling products for a short period of time. Unfortunately, the growing popularity of tablets spelled the death of the Eee PC in 2013. 2012 – Google Nexus – An Asus Tablet </p><h2>2012 – Google Nexus – An Asus Tablet</h2><p>With the growing popularity of tablets, Asus was quick to kill off underperforming products to tap into new markets. They released the Nexus 7 tablet, branded as a Google device. While not the first company to produce tablets, the popularity of the Nexus 7 is a tribute to its price to performance offerings. The innovative tablet was immensely popular from its initial launch in 2012, with many retailers running out of stock quickly. Additionally, magazines like Engadget and PC World pointed out the competitive pricing and unique benefits of the Nexus 7 tablet.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-xl-12 col-md-12 col-12"><h2> History</h2><p style="font-size:25px;"> The end of the 1990s was a time of rapid growth for Asus. The company prioritized talent acquisition and research into new technologies. Because of this, they were able to bring radical new technology to market before their competitors. Asus began trading as a public company in 1996, with an official listing on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Thanks to Asus, Taiwan became a hub for technology with a reputation for quality components and new development. The company branched out into the mobile computing market with the release of the Asus P6300 laptop in 1997. By 2000, the company opened customer service centers in China, the Netherlands, the United States, Australia, and Japan. With such extensive marketing efforts, the company soon became a household name, especially with further advances in the laptop market. The early 2000s saw Asus release an array of experimental technologies. It started with the launch of the world’s first ever PDA, or personal digital assistant. An early precursor to the modern smartphone, the PDA was designed to take notes, hold dates in a calendar, and offer functions like a calculator and clock. While not a smashing commercial success, the Asus PDA ran on the Intel PXA250 CPU and was officially named the Asus MyPal. </p></div></div></div><footer><div class="footer_row"><div class="logo"><div class="logo_pic"><img src="'+n+'" alt=""></div><h1 style="color:aliceblue;">KMHPC</h1></div><div class="More"><h1>More product</h1><p><a href="#">Asus</a></p><p><a href="#">Lanovo</a></p><p><a href="#">Dell</a></p><p><a href="#">MSI</a></p></div><div class="contact"><h1>Contact</h1><p>khymenghuot@gmail.com</p><p>phone number: 015201639</p><p>telegram: khymenghuot</p></div></div></footer>',4);function d(h,p){return a(),o(s,null,[l,c],64)}const m=t(r,[["render",d]]);export{m as default};
